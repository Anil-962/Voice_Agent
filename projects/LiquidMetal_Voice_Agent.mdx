##LiquidMetal Voice Agent
#Overview

- LiquidMetal Voice Agent is a real-time conversational AI system built using the Raindrop Platform, 
Vultr Inference, and ElevenLabs streaming TTS. It delivers natural, ultra-low-latency voice interactions 
with persistent memory, contextual reasoning, and a production-ready pipeline designed for scalable voice applications.

#Key Features

- Real-time Voice Pipeline: Streaming STT → NLU → LLM reasoning → ElevenLabs TTS
- Persistent SmartMemory: Remembers user context across turns
- Document-Aware Intelligence: SmartBuckets for transcript and embedding retrieval
- Low-Latency Architecture: Optimized WebSocket audio streaming
- Robust Error Handling: Connection retries, reconnection logic, and clean UI states

#How It Works

-The system uses Raindrop SmartInference to orchestrate speech recognition, NLU, and reasoning in sequence. SmartMemory stores user context, while SmartBuckets maintains audio, transcripts, and embeddings for retrieval. ElevenLabs provides real-time streaming TTS, and Vultr Inference enhances intent detection and reasoning accuracy. A React + TypeScript frontend streams audio via WebSockets to a Node.js backend connected to the Raindrop MCP Server.

#Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs API: Streaming Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Raindrop Platform: SmartInference, SmartMemory, SmartBuckets, SmartSQL
- Vultr Inference: Intent detection, reranking, NLU enhancement
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, WebSockets, Audio APIs
- Backend: Node.js, Raindrop MCP Server
- Tools: AI Coding Assistants (Claude Code / Gemini CLI)
